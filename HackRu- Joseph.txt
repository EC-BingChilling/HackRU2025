Progress Summary
1. Frontend Development (V0)

   * Chose to build the frontend using V0 for speed and ease.

   * Exported the V0 frontend, which includes:

      * Textarea for note input

      * Dropdown for mode selection

      * Cards for displaying flashcards and quiz questions

      * Audio player for ElevenLabs summaries

         2. Repository Setup

            * Attempted to clone teammate’s GitHub repo via VS Code, ran into GitHub authentication issues due to password deprecation.

            * Downloaded the repository as a ZIP directly from GitHub as a workaround.

            * Opened the repository in VS Code and prepared it for integration with V0 code.

               3. Integration Plan

                  * Ready to replace placeholder API endpoint (https://example.com/api/generate) in notes-section.tsx with the real backend endpoint once received.

                  * All V0 frontend components are ready to be merged into the repo.

                     4. Deployment Preparation

                        * Project folder organized and ready for deployment to Vercel.

                        * Tested local setup with Node.js optional, ensuring UI components display correctly.

                           5. Next Steps (Awaiting Backend Endpoint)

                              * Replace placeholder API with real endpoint in the frontend.

                              * Deploy the frontend to Vercel and attach a .tech domain if desired.

                              * Finalize Canva slides for pitch with screenshots and feature descriptions.
